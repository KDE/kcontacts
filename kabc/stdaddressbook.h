  Standard KDE address book
 
  This class provides access to the standard KDE address book shared by all
  applications.
 
  It's implemented as a singleton. Use self() to get the address book
  object. On the first self() call the address book also gets loaded.
  
  Example:
 
  \code
  KABC::AddressBook *ab = KABC::StdAddressBook::self();
 
  KABC::AddressBook::Iterator it;
  for ( it = ab->begin(); it != ab->end(); ++it ) {
    kdDebug() << "UID=" << (*it).uid() << endl;
 
    // do some other stuff
  }
 
  KABC::StdAddressBook::save();
  \endcode
