For testing the vcardparser there are some test files and a small testsuite
automatically checking for regressions. The tests directory contains some vCard
files and correpsonding reference output files (with an additional ".ref"
suffix). For running the geression test do "make check". This will compile some
test programs, parse the test files, write them out as vCard again and compare
the output to the reference file. The check fails, if there are unexpected
differences and shows which lines differed.

For creating a new test put a vCard file to be parsed into the tests directory.
Create a reference file by running "testread" on the test file. It will put out
the parsed data as vCard again on stdout. Carefully check the output, manually
correct any errors and save the result as reference file in the tests directory.
Now add the filename to the TESTFILES variable in Makefile.am and run "make
check". If the check fails adapt the reference file or fix the bugs in the
parser, whatever is appropriate.
