For testing the vcardparser there are some test files and a small testsuite
automatically checking for regressions. The tests directory contains some vCard
files and correpsonding reference output files (with an additional ".ref"
suffix). For running the geression test do "./testroundtrip" or simply run "ctest".

For creating a new test put a vCard file to be parsed into the tests directory.
Create a reference file by running "testread" on the test file. It will put out
the parsed data as vCard again on stdout. Carefully check the output, manually
correct any errors and save the result as reference file in the tests directory.
Now add the filename to the testroundtrip.qrc resource file and run
"make && ./roundtriptest" If the check fails adapt the reference file or fix the bugs
in the parser, whatever is appropriate.
