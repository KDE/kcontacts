A Resource using DB3 to access the evolution
addressbook make sure the wombat is not running
In future versions I may use bonobo to access it...


DESIGN:
The Format vs Resource idea is somehow not applyable to the
Evolution PAS

Format would be vCard and Resource would be DB3..
BUT
Format get's a QFile* pointer which is just not usable
with a DB3
INSTEAD we will use the vCardImpl directly to convert 
a string to Addressee
