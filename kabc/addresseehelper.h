 * - a list of honoric prefixes, like "Mrs.", "Prof." etc,
 *   see containsTitle()
 * - a list of inclusions, such as "van" or "de", see
 *   containsPrefix()
 * - a list of honoric suffixes, such as "I" or "Jr.", see
 *   containsSuffix()
 *
 * All of these lists have a hardcoded and a configurable
 * part. The configurable part is found in @c kabcrc, group
 * @c General, fields @c Prefixes, @c Inclusions, and
 * @c Suffixes.
 *
 * In addition to the above, this class stores one conveniece
 * setting: it stores whether or not a single name component
 * should be interpreted as a family name (see
 * tradeAsFamilyName()). The corresponding configuration
 * field is @c TradeAsFamilyName.
